# Project Name: Marvel GIF's, Assemble!

## Description
As a development group, we were tasked to build a unique API application with various elements we all have learned in class.
Our motivation for this project was for the sole purpose to help Marvel fanatics out there have the accesability in finding GIF's associated with the characters from the Marvel Universe. The purpose for this application is to assist Marvel fans out there find some of their favorite GIF's involving their favorite Marvel Characters. The problem this application solves is how it is such a necessary tool for anyone who is a fan of Marvel to readily have access, and in general, to find all kinds of GIF's relating to their favorite characters they search into.
